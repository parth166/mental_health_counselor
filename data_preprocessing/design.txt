Rough notes for design considerations

Current Schema:
{
    questionId: 
    questionTitle:
    questionText: 
    questionLink: 
    topic:                              # is a categorical variable, check categories
    therapistInfo:                      # Need to extract unique therapists and assign a false ID to them.
    therapistUrl:
    answerText: 
    upvotes: ~ int feature          
    views: 
}

General checks I need to perform:
1. Missing fields

Data Cleaning:
1. Groupby question ID
2. Clean therapistInfo and extract therapist name.


General structure:


Question table:
{
    questionId: 
    questionTitle:
    questionText: 
    questionLink: 
    topic:
    responses: [
        {
            therapistInfo:                     
            therapistUrl:
            answerText: 
            upvotes: ~ int feature          
            views: 
        }
    ]                     
}
